# Player

A simple, yet modern player with now playing info for SHOUTca.st.

Player is designed for modern browsers, and as such, it will not support legacy browsers.

# Contributing

Instead of following a formal style guide, just make sure that any new
code passes ESLint (a git hook is provided to run ESLint automatically)
and follows the existing code style.

See WORKFLOW.md for more info on the development workflow.
